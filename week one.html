<h1>Response to Week One Readings - Vidur Bahl</h1>
<p style="background-color: steelblue;" style="text-align: center;" style="font-size: 60px;"> The two readings this week were, on the face of it, vastly different from each other. While one was an old article written long ago, about essentially the progression and possibilities that science and technology have, the other was one written about the web and the internet, and what is going wrong with the way weâ€™re using it without adhering to its founding principles of universality. 

However, in my view, both of them have one foundation concept in common: that technology develops. As the 1945 article by Bush speaks about the developments in photography, or more importantly what could happen to photography and the potential applications of those developments, he captures very clearly the realities of the web. And that the universality of the web is essentially a breeding ground for innovation. 

Just like the universality of the photographic technology and its potential innovation that Bush speaks about, Lee emphasizes that if we lose the founding principles of the web, we may lose that potential innovation. </p>
