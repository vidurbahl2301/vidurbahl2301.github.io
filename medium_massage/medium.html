	<p id="hiddenMessage" style="display: none;">The true consequentiality and meaning in this book is correctly expressed through a simple printing error that occurred in 1967, at the time of the book’s production. The author had initially named the book “The medium is the Message”, but a printing error returned the book to him with the title “The Medium is the Massage”. The author was so fond of this error, that he decided to keep the mistake, renaming his entire book. It can be said that he kept the the erroneous word “Massage” in the title because in some ways, the book is about how the mediums we use to communicate and disseminate information massage our brains, altering the way we think and the way we do life. What’s incredible to me is that the book was able to so accurately represent and talk about a sort of technological revolution in communication and dissemination about 30 years before even the World Wide Web was a thing. Relevant examples of what the book speaks about are so recent, even as recent at the January 6th incident at the US Capitol. That insurrection was cultivated and organized via our new mediums, that transform us from mere consumers of information to producers of information.</p>
