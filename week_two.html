	<p style="font-family:courier;", style="color:red;">All four episodes of this series deal with four different topics, all dealing with art and how we perceive it, and what does our perception of it mean. A large part of this series deals with old, European art in oil paintings of landscapes and nudes of the female form. What I found interesting about this was that the show acknowledges that, to put it lightly, nudes of the female form in oil paintings existed largely for the pleasure of the men that looked at these paintings. This argument was justified using the poses that the women took, and how it always made them “available” and that they had no desire of their own, they plainly existed to serve the desire of these men. </p>

<p style="font-family:courier;" style="color:red;">Personally, I responded to that since for the longest time, I have resented old European art. For no more reason than simply that it was made by and for mostly rich white men to enjoy. </p>

<p style="font-family:courier;" style="color:red;">Another aspect of this show that I found to be interesting was the way that Berger connected what we saw in those old oil paintings from over a century ago to modern day advertisement and publicity, and the lines he drew between the two. Mostly about how both of them sort of appeal to the same base instincts in humans. </p>

<p style="font-family:courier;" style="color:red;">However, what I found to be the most interesting in this series was the first episode where cameras and the reproduction and democratization of high art was discussed. Fancy paintings went from being gate kept (literally) from people who couldn’t be in the room it was in for various reasons, to be able to be on screens all over the world. I, personally, am a fan of this. Art is for everyone, not just the rich in the right places.</p> 

<p style="font-family:courier;" style="color:red;">I also enjoyed the way the series explored how the meaning of a painting changes based on camera movement and music, I thought it was largely reminiscent of certain things in modern culture and how something can be changed based on how its presented. </p>
